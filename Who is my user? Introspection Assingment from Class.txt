Notes for my project “Harvard Happiness Hub”


1. The person who will use my project is: My persona, Alison, and those who like to watch vlogs that have a story, that end with a question. She works as a barista in a coffee shop in Cambridge and is a student at BU. She watches Vlogs before going to bed. She likes learning about other people through the Vlogs.  Attached below is a longer description of My persona in detail. 
2. (I) Will be happy my project exists if one of the two following happens: 
I post it online and it becomes interactive and even, ideally, self maintaining.
I will pitch it to my boss at EDx and we can use this as a template for interactive educational video platforms.
3. The first 10 minutes of using/interacting with my project will look like: Opening the website on laptop or mobile device, viewing the “featured video”, smiling, empathizing and feeling both comfortable and a sense of community, and inspired by one of the lessons from the video. This will take 3-5 minutes. After this will be time of introspection about the question that I asked, thinking “what would I have answered if I were to post a response like I was asked to in the video?” and thinking “will I actually record a response?” while possibly browsing through other videos that were posted by others and haven’t make it to being “featured” or browsing other “featured” previous videos. Either this or self recording a response to my prompt question.
4. By the end of tonight, i’d like to be able to decide what format I am using.



Alison’s Interview - MY PERSONA:

I interviewed Alison and created my Real Persona with the help of questions and tips that I read in my selected book “Disciplined Entrepreneurship” by Bill Aulet from MIT
Alison
21 years young - math major and philosophy. Boston University.
Job-barista part time and student full time
WHAT DOES SHE Say

i like to follow in videos on that person's hand that keeps on being in the video
or if they have a cat i like hearing about their cat/person every week

”OMG if i could afford a paper that would be so cool”.
“i like to hear people's voices and hear them share stories”
“when u read it seems to edited, if u just wrote your train of thought u wont enjoy reading it”
“...but when someone talks u notice where they pause, where they smile in stories, all these little micro expressions and learn where they paused before q etc. you can see the expressions. u can tell when they are thinking.”
“The french “um” is so distracting for americans but i like it because it is um from the gut and so sincere.”
“I like things that are unusual different, mixing patterns.” “weird patterns that look like old people will wear them.”
“like funny things”
“Oh that is so cute”
“Hashtag!”
uses a lot of play on words
WHAT DOES SHE LIKE TO Do

watch video comedy.
in general likes to:hang out in her coop house.
make food.
going out to specific specialty food places. cupcake, doughnuts.
i like to wear things appropriate to the occasion, i was visiting a toddler so i wore a shirt with a cat since he learned the words cat. or he likes to point out.
when i do math hw i dress weird even though its boring it makes the process exciting.
SPECIAL AND IDENTIFIABLE things about her- for example, she created a prime numbers poster and hung on top of her bed.
WEBSITES she likes: “i don't surf the web that often, i don't use fb regularly. i read food blogs, but less and less now bc they are not vegan. i enjoy reading vegan good blogs because that is relevant to my lifestyle right now. “

INSTAGRAM AND TWITTER, APPS-very passionate about apps sooooo much,I use them a lot...all the time!

TV SHOWS- “so much tv!!!!! every night before i go to sleep which is a terrible habit but everyone does it lately. but i don't like watching movies, and i don't like watching movies with ppl because then i feel trapped that i have to watch it”

WHERE DOES SHE LIKE TO HANG OUT: “traveling, south america next. don't like hotel vacations i like by myself or a big group of ppl who are adventures and don't mind staying in hostels etc. “

Before going to work, Alison does: “well, it changes every semester - i do as little as possible - i get up the minimum i already have my outfit in my head so i don't have to think about it - i look at phone - buss time and listen to radio on way to work unless i take my bike, its not safe. “
WHAT DOES SHE Think ABOUT

likes to see other peoples perspectives
tv series on characters lives you get the same happiness like checking in with friends (fulfillment) even if its not back and forth, you are having sincere happy feelings. it is weird to me but so true. but you really get attached to a person i keep seeing their story life.

Alison’s heroes: “somebody that i personally know - friends of mine. like first is my sister - only in my family i consider a hero. older sister  she consistently loving to others and doesn't think so highly of herself, her actions are very aligned with her ethics. how can she so perfect for so long. i just found out she struggles with making friends that was shocking to me. i am not concerned for her. “

Favorite video log emotistyle the people wear these really fun to look at outfits. Like polka dot shirt, striped pants, it is fun bc its different.
“I like things that are unusual different, mixing patterns.” “weird patterns that look like old people will wear them.”

When they end the vlog with a story prompt/question it makes her try and think of her own life and how it reflects to her life, and she thinks about it more then. Also she is interested in other people's responses of how they dealt with similar situation.
HOW DOES SHE Feel

“My friend that are not from the house describe me as mysterious. they don't know where my limits are in life. when i meet someone new i don't tell them my age. it gives me anxiety. i also don't tell them where i am from
or that i am close with my siblings because that’s weird.
when i traveled through europe i lied about my age”.
”i don’t tell anybody that i watch vlogs since its lame 21 year old 21st century to do and afraid others will think its a waste of time, and i try to minimize how much i watch them. i watch to relax and entertain. if i watch a serious vlog then i watch it to learn. “
“if someone will send me a link i will likely NOT watch it, it feels obligatory and takes away the fun.” she does not like when another person takes a video to show her.
Alison’s Motivations/What are you excited about: “Other people are concerned about my next action - but i feel it's gonna be just fine. I think I will continue school research math etc -but then i also wanna do radio - and activism in addition. i feel very motivated to do a lot of things.”
“i feel pressure to live in a lot of other places like out of the US - or near my family in ny. “
When did u get so excited that you can't sleep? “something i will stay up dreaming about.. let me think... how i wanna cut my hair next week! or the next trip i am taking. fantasising about my next trip and logistics and planning. how to get there, when is the flight cheapest, maybe i will check the website of sailing, where can i stay at.”

Alison’s Fears: losing my teeth and having to wear dentures. i had to take off an entire semester for paying the dental care i had. having kids and regretting it. i see a trend in my life: i make friends, then moving away and coming back and having one friend left - afraid to continue that and have no friends eventually.

Note to self: THROW IN MOMENTS OF MY SELF FEELINGS AND THOUGHTS - VERY SHORT
Her cousin and her used to share a vlog and due to schedule restrictions so they just posted a video a day to share with each other and leave a video for them! its kind of watching a vlog regularly and interact with it.
“i like to hear people's voices and hear them share stories”
“when u read it seems to edited, if u just wrote your train of thought u wont enjoy reading it”
“...but when someone talks u notice where they pause, where they smile in stories, all these little micro expressions and learn where they paused before q etc. you can see the expressions. u can tell when they are thinking.”
“The french “um” is so distracting for americans but i like it because it is um from the gut and so sincere.”
 
Alison’s Design preferences: linear videos. all in straight line going down. endless scrolling is her favorite. And when you can see which is the newest. top.
“like funny things”

WHY does Alison like VLOGS:”i don’t tell anybody that i watch vlogs since its lame 21 year old 21st century to do and afraid others will think its a waste of time, and i try to minimize how much i watch them. i watch to relax and entertain. if i watch a serious vlog then i watch it to learn. “
“if someone will send me a link i will likely NOT watch it, it feels obligatory and takes away the fun.” she does not like when another person takes a video to show her.
 
Alison READs daily: ny times and bbc. and listen to npr news. “usually while i commute”.
”OMG if i could afford a paper that would be so cool”.
“for pleasure i read lots of philosophy articles and books”.
novels: “i just take friends recommendations i don't go to a bookstore and have a certain style.”
 
WEBSITES she likes: “i don't surf the web that often, i don't use fb regularly. i read food blogs, but less and less now bc they are not vegan. i enjoy reading vegan good blogs because that is relevant to my lifestyle right now. “

SPECIAL AND IDENTIFIABLE things about her- for example, she created a prime numbers poster and hung on top of her bed.
 
Her NEEDS AND WANTS: “now everyday i work towards - thats why i am exhausted- is getting good grades, i don't care anymore but in habit at this point. i wanna respect the person i was 3 years ago. i dont know what i wanna do long term and i really like that. right now i don't wanna know what i will do in the long term setting although in the future i will wanna know”.
 
Her FEAR:”that i spend so much time in philosophy and regret it in the future since its something i wanna avoid.“
 
“i feel like if you were to interview a stranger they would analyze it non honest - but since we are close i am more. i would not tell a person on the street about TV watching or my teeth. “
 
I think she is, socially very open, extrovert.
She shares a lot by being open and makes others feel more comfy.
co workers too? depends, this job not open but other jobs she is comfy.
“My friend that are not from the house describe me as mysterious. they don't know where my limits are in life. when i meet someone new i don't tell them my age. it gives me anxiety. i also don't tell them where i am from
or that i am close with my siblings because that’s weird.
when i traveled through europe i lied about my age”.

Video Website titled: Harvard Happiness Hub

Every week/Bi weekly
Week I: I post a vlog, content is 1. Me sharing a personal story and then 2. Connecting the story to a positive psychology info piece. 3. Ending the vlog with an open ended question calling others to share a story with the prompted specific theme.

Between week I and week II other people post videos with their own stories that connect with my prompt.

Week II: I feature a selected video of 1. One of the video 2esponse stories, and 2. I point out an element in their story which I then connect with a Positive Psychology info piece. 3. Ending the vlog with an open ended question calling others to share a story with a specific theme.

Between week II and week III other people post videos with their own stories that connect with my prompt.

And so on, and so forth…

___________

Popularity plan:
I actively pursue friends and colleagues to post a story for me, hoping to get some Harvard professors to share and some celebrities too. Slowly spread the word to other famous personas. Summer comes I take the initiative to lead a student group and invite celebrities for events, or simply join one of the student groups so I get a budget and invite celebrities to speak of their journey and share a story, which I can later feature too!

Website Programing Logistics:
Ability to post video LINKS (from vimeo, youtube,facebook, vine, etc). 
Links to positive psychology sources
Scroll down locations to videos ordered by date (endless amount of scrolling for however videos may come in the future)
A search link for videos by: lenght/popularity/date (views)(Perhaps youtube will be the only spot for the video posts)
[this one is not a must] A search link for videos by subject
