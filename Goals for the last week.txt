Final-Project-HHH-Shalhavit
===========================
(note:the previous writing assignment is in the earlier iteration  repository “ FinalProjectHarvardHappinessHub”)

My ‘DONE’ Today: To make changes in writing and understand the “making it live” process and edit all the things (or at least a bunch) of my “To Do” list that I accumulated this week: changing URLs, Changing text, and overall understanding GoDaddy a bit.

My ‘DONE’ Next week: Well, I hope to fix some technicalities in the video exporting process as they came out with pixelized parts As far as web design goes: I would like to try and add the HashTag option (Bakhtiar suggested wisely to do so through twitter - and perhaps in future upload to twitter immediately) and/or add a Comment option underneath the videos. Either this by next week or create another page just for comments. 
It might be the best thing to at least create a document /jpg of the vision so even if it’s not all ready by next week I can continue working on it and have a clear goal in mind.
I would also like to get more user feedback this week from those who submitted  videos for my project and those who watched it. 
I want to present this interactive learning platform format to my boss at EDx and therefore I want to be sure that my website is: A.Presentable B.That the vision is clear enough even if the sight is yet imperfect.
